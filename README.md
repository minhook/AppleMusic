The improved iTunes for Windows 10 and 11

## What's different?

Apple Music player is a improved version of iTunes that really only brings a better look to the app.

## How does it work?

The player simply displays the [web player](https://music.apple.com/us/browse) and displays it within its own app (Why can't Apple do something this simple? Who knows!)
